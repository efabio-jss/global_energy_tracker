## ⚙️ Global Renewable Power Intelligence: MySQL | Power BI | Python

This project integrates data analysis, geospatial modelling, and automation into a single scalable architecture for the renewable energy sector.

---

### 1️⃣ MySQL  
Consolidation of global projects data (**Solar ☀️, Wind 🌬️, Hydro 💧**) into an optimized relational database, enabling:
- Quality control  
- Incremental integration  
- Geographic queries  

---

### 2️⃣ Power BI  
Semantic modelling and interactive dashboards with:
- KPIs  
- Percentiles  
- Concentration indices (HHI)  
- Maps and distributions by country, region, and technology  

Each page (**Solar, Wind, Hydro**) provides a complete analysis of installed capacity, operational status, and geographic distribution.

---

### 3️⃣ Python & GeoTools  
Leveraging the same unified data model, the script automatically generates:
- 🌍 **KMZ files** for Google Earth  
- 🗺️ **GeoPackage (.gpkg)** and **GeoJSON** layers for QGIS  
- Dynamic filters by country and region  
- Embedded metadata such as Capacity (MW) and Status  

---

💡 The process is **fully reproducible and scalable**, allowing expansion to new technologies:
Biomass 🌱 | Geothermal 🌋 | Thermal 🔥 | Hydrogen 🧪 | Nuclear ⚛️

---

### 🔗 Technology Stack
**MySQL | Power BI | Python (pandas, geopandas, simplekml) | GeoJSON | KMZ | Automation**

---

### 📊 Key Results
- ✔️ Consolidation of **10,000+ global renewable projects**  
- ✔️ Automatic KPIs by technology and region  
- ✔️ Instant geospatial export in multiple formats  
- ✔️ Data foundation ready for **external APIs and Machine Learning pipelines**
```
